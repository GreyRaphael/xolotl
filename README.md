README.txt for Xolotl

Xolotl is a continuum simulator under development within two DOE SciDAC programs, available at https://github.com/ORNL-Fusion/xolotl . It is a high-performance computing code using advection-reaction-diffusion kinetic rate theory to model the time evolution of the divertor material in next generation tokamaks like ITER, as well as nuclear fuel in fission reactors.

You can find more information about this code on our [Wiki](https://github.com/ORNL-Fusion/xolotl/wiki).

Xolotl uses CMake, MPI, PETSc, Kokkos, Boost, HDF5 as described in [Build Configuration](https://github.com/ORNL-Fusion/xolotl/wiki/Build-Configuration).

If you want to contribute please check [Guidelines](https://github.com/ORNL-Fusion/xolotl/wiki/Guidelines).
